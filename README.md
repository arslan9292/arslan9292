- 👋 Hey Everyone! I’m Arslan Ahmad (@arslan9292)
- 👀 I’m interested in creating new innovative things (yes, that includes coding) which can help doing tasks easier ;) 
- I am an Electronics & Communication Enginner so I like playing around with Robots (mostly using Arduino).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Shell Scripting, Automation tools like Ansible.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving Python/Shell Scripting or Arduino programming languages.
- I like automating things so you can count on for Ansible :)
